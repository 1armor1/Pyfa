description = "Pyfa (the Python Fitting Assistant) is a standalone application able to create and simulate fittings for EVE-Online SciFi MMORPG with a very high degree of accuracy.\nPyfa can be virtually ran on all platforms where python and wxwidgets are supported, and, in order to make things effortless for you, we maintain daily builds for OSX/WIN32(64) and LINUX (http://www.evefit.org/Pyfa/Installation). The layout of pyfa is somewhat similar to  EFT ( EVE fitting tool ), but , it goes way beyond EFT in terms of functionality, accuracy and usefulness. While Pyfa is a completely new application unrelated to EFT, it is able to import/export  EFT style fits without any hassle.\n\n\nAll EVE-Online related materials are property of CCP hf.\n\nSilk Icons Set by famfamfam.com released under Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License"
